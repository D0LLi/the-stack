The Stack is a space where Daily Bruin's developers are free to create and experiment with online journalism.

This blog is a constant feed from our Online department with creations – large and small – and a behind-the-scenes view of how we are making digital content. We are focusing on providing a restriction-free environment so developers can build what they want, when they want, and pursue projects that push the boundaries of modern journalism.

We are focused on an open source approach and will be providing links to GitHub repositories and datasets used in our projects. If you are ever curious about something or want to see the code/data behind a project and it’s not clearly available, feel free to email the editor for more information.

Harrison Liddiard is the current editor of The Stack.
