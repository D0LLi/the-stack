The Stack is [Daily Bruin’s](http://dailybruin.com/) data journalism and newsroom tech blog. We investigate public data, experiment with technology and apply quantitative insights to real life.

At present, information is being created faster than anyone can consume it. Most of it is noise to the average person, but occasionally there's something important. This important data usually never reaches people because it is difficult to find, difficult to collect, or difficult to understand. News organizations have not kept pace with finding, analyzing, and explaining this important information to the people who care about it.

The Stack exists to fulfill this need for the UCLA community. We will examine data from UC employee pay and weaknesses of campus systems to 800 Degrees' pizzas of the day and where you should go over spring break.

If it's something you care about, and there's insight to be gained from data, we'll cover it.

The Daily Bruin has one of the largest and most accomplished teams of student developers at a university news organization in the world. Our team is excited to take risks, explore new ways to tell meaningful stories, and build tools to help journalism succeed. Occasionally we'll geek out about a JavaScript library we're loving or a workflow tool we've built to others interested in journalism and computer science, but for the most part, we'll keep our posts squarely centered on what most UCLA students and Westwood residents find important.

The Daily Bruin is a community newspaper, and we plan on giving back to the community – both our own Westwood community and larger communities of university news organizations and individuals interested in data for public good. That's why we're making all the code on this blog [available under open-source licenses on GitHub](https://github.com/daily-bruin/) and all the datasets we collect and parse [available to everyone](https://github.com/daily-bruin/datasets/).

Whether as a reader or a collaborator, we hope you'll join us on this exciting data experiment.
