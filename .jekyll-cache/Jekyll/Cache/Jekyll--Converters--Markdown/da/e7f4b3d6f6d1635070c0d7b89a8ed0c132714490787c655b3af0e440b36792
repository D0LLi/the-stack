I"˜<p>A microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics student, Nick covers Gene Block and his crew in addition to campus politics, which means he enjoys spending his Tuesday nights at Kerckhoff 417, where USAC meets. He has no idea what he wants to do with his life, but he likes writing and has an interest in studying viruses. Heâ€™s a master of the top-button-unbuttoned-with-tie-and-boutonniere look.</p>
