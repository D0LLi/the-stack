I"Ì<p>This year, each undergraduate student will pay around $160 to the undergraduate student government to fund its associated programs.</p>

<p>These fees result from ballot measures that received a majority of student votes in previous USAC elections. Each fee referendumâ€™s text and its margin of passage is available on USACâ€™s website.</p>

<p>The most recently added fee is the Cultural Affairs Commission Arts Restoring Community fee, which was passed in 2014.</p>

<p>Despite the sizable increase in USAC fees over the last decade, the increase in recent years is still less than the increase in the UCâ€™s average annual student charges for undergraduate students.</p>

<p>The annual USAC fee was set at $24 in 1982 and has risen to $160.44 in 2014, a 6.7x increase. On average, an in-state UC student was charged $647 per year in 1982 and $13,317 in 2014, a 10.2x increase.</p>

<p>The graph below compares each yearâ€™s UC and USAC fees relative to their initial fees in 1982.</p>
