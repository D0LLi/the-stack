departments.txt format:
  department name (edited for link)
  department abbreviation (edited for link)
Ex:
  Biological+Chemistry+
  BIOL+CH

class parser csv file name format:
  day-hour-second.csv
We really only care about day/hour, second is to distinguish the day/hour files ran at the same time from different people

CSV data format:
  department abbreviation class name
  spots filled, spots total, spots left
0,0,0 means class is closed/full
-1,-1,-1 means class is waitlisted
Ex:
  AERO+ST A - Leadership Laboratory
  0,120,120
Department abbreviation is AERO+ST, aka Aerospace Studies
Class name is A - Leadership Laboratory
it has 0 spots filled, 120 spots total, and 120 spots open

- some classes may have multiple rows of data, this is for the class being held at different times/professors
  - we only get class data, not discussion data
  - we also do not get professor data

General way of how program works:
iterate through departments by getting its link
  iterate through pages by clicking on the page nums
    press the expand all classes button
      get the text of all the classes
        determine if its closed/open/waitlisted and print to csv

if at any step something fails, we wait/press it again/skip to the next department/page

important variables:
timeout: how long we wait for a page to load, currently 10 seconds
status_column_load: we check that the expand all classes button has been pressed by seeing if each class has a status_column html div
  However, we can't wait for a certain # of them to have loaded (for all the classes) (the java version of selenium lets you do this but not python)
so we just sleep for status_column_load seconds, currently 2 seconds

4-23-5.csv is one of Andrew's test csvs on all the classes (doesn't have department abbreviation in front)
