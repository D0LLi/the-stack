class parser csv file name format:
  day-hour-second.csv
We really only care about day/hour, second is to distinguish the day/hour files from different people

CSV data format:
  class name
  spots filled, spots total, spots left
0,0,0 means class is closed/full
-1,-1,-1 means class is waitlisted

At the end of the CSV file is the total # of open/closed classes found

General way of how program works:
iterate through departments by getting its link
  iterate through pages by clicking on the page num
    press the expand all classes button
      get the text of all the classes
        determine if its closed/open/waitlisted and print to csv

if at any step something fails, we wait/press it again/skip to the next department/page
