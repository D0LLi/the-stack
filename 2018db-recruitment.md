The start of each school year brings new beginnings for the Daily Bruin as its applications start to flood in. With it comes a wave of talented new interns and exciting opportunities for the staff to grow. 
</p>

The application process itself spans the course of two? weeks. First, prospective interns fill out an application online, which typically involves a resume drop and responses to short answer questions. The editors then select a subset of the applicants to interview in person. Once the interns have been chosen, they undergo training that spans the rest of the quarter.

<p class = "para">
The application process remains ever competitive. This year boasted a 43 percent overall acceptance rate, comparable to last year’s 42 percent but still a drop to 2016’s 50 percent. The number of applied and accepted interns remained fairly constant; 209 out of 490 interns were accepted this year versus 206 out of 488 interns who were accepted last year. 
</p>

<p class = "para">
Online (including the Stack), the most-applied-to section at 132 applications, became intensely more harsh with its applicants this year. Not only does the section continue to have double the applicants of other major sections, it also halved its accepted interns this year to 17. This resulted in the section this year having a stark 13 percent acceptance rate. 
</p>

<p class = "para">
Not all was woe for this year’s applicants however. Graphics has a major boost in intern power, increasing its intern size from five the past two years to nine this year. News will also experience growth changes. While the number of applicants nearly doubled from last year, it also took 50 percent more interns. Opinion is the last of the growing trio, jumping from 11 interns in 2017 to 24 this year.

<p class = "para">
This year, first year students comprised the majority of the incoming Daily Bruin intern class, at a total of 51%. They dominated the Photo and Design intern classes, comprising 73% and 90% of each class, respectively. Furthermore, nearly seven times more freshmen were admitted than seniors. 
</p>

<p class = "para">
The second most represented age groups were second and third year students. The number of second year student interns was comparable to the number of third year students, with second year students trailing third year students by 1%. Second year students comprised 44% of both Graphics’ and Video’s incoming classes. On the other hand, third year students comprised 35% of the Online intern class and 33% of the Blogging class. 
</p>

<p class = "para">
Though second and third year students were well represented in certain sections, the proportion of accepted interns per class decreased as age increased.

Even though the stats and process may seem daunting, new and returning applicants should not be afraid to apply in the future. The Daily Bruin offers its staff countless opportunities to express their journalistic side, whether it be through reporting breaking news, designing stunning illustrations, or creating blog posts. The experience is more than well worth the application.
