35,177 undergraduate students enroll in UCLA courses each quarter. Competing for a limited number of spots in each lecture hall, discussion section, and/or lab, students find that the enrollment period is one of the most stressful times for UCLA undergraduates. Failing to find a seat in the classes that a major requires may jeopardize study abroad aspirations, on-time graduation, and much more.

Explore how quickly UCLA courses fill up.

Kaitlin Kearns, a second year Economics student, describes herself during the week of enrollment as tense, stressed, and anxious. Though UCLA randomly assigns enrollment passes to students within the same unit bracket, Kearns received one of the latest passes in the “Sophomore Standing” bracket. This proved to be an issue when she attempted to register for Economics 101, an upper division economics class required for her previous pre-major, Business Economics. Economics 101 offers around 400 spots each quarter, but by the date of Kearns’ first pass, the class was full. That enrollment difficulty forced Kearns to take her major prerequisites in a different order than encouraged by the department. Had Kearns stayed in the Business Economics pre-major, her hypothetical major application would have been pushed back for up to two quarters.

General education classes are a chance for students to explore a myriad of academic fields. However, many students, including Kearns, do not have the opportunity to take the classes that intrigue them most due to enrollment difficulties: “sometimes I feel like I can't take classes that are pertinent to my academic interests or fit with what I'm trying to get out of my college education. That doesn't mean that I'm not taking classes that are super fulfilling or anything, it just means that sometimes the classes that ... best correspond to my academic needs are completely filled up before my first pass even begins.”

Additionally, many South Campus majors require enough core courses that students do not have a chance to dabble in many other subjects; students must pick their academic path early on and stick to it, with little room for deviance.

All life-science majors are required to take similar - if not the same - prerequisites. Megana Saripella, a third year neuroscience and pre-med student, describes how enrollment issues snowball from one incoming freshman class to the next: “people older than you are being forced to take these classes because they can’t take them as freshmen. Then, when you come as freshmen, because so many other people are taking them, you can't get in anymore.”

In addition to second year students taking spots often intended for first years, the vast majority of life-science classes require prerequisites that layer on top of each other. Saripella gave the example of math requirements for a physics series, which are prerequisites of other classes in her neuroscience major. Similarly, students need to finish a Chemistry series consisting of six classes to qualify to take Biochemistry classes, which are also prerequisites to study for the MCAT and for upper-division neuroscience major courses.

Saripella states that the number of classes required for pre-med students to begin studying for the MCAT takes almost exactly two years,“but if you take into account the fact that you're not going to get into every class… you might not be able to take that in two years. And if you can't take that in two years, you have to push them to your third year, which forces a gap year on you that [you] necessarily would not have had to take.” While enrollment difficulties may leave pre-med students with no choice but to take a gap year, choosing to take a year off between an undergraduate degree and medical school is becoming increasingly popular.

Because many upper division courses are reserved for students in that major or minor during first pass, students in interdepartmental programs may struggle with getting into the classes they want or need. However, depending on the department, counselors may open spots for students to enroll in their needed courses during first pass. Saripella also stated that the Neuroscience department is helpful in allowing its students who take major requirements in other departments to bypass the prerequisites specific to those departments.

Sandy Valdivieso, an academic counselor for International Development Studies and Global Studies, both of which are interdepartmental programs, noted that she stresses flexibility in first pass enrollment. Because the Global Studies department offers at least three core classes each quarter, Valdivieso advises students to fill their first pass with core courses and to wait for second pass to sign up for classes in other departments.

Valdivieso acknowledges that interdepartmental enrollment can be difficult on students because they often cannot get into their first or second choices for elective courses. Valdivieso stresses the importance of enrolling exactly when the enrollment appointment opens to increase the odds of getting into desired classes. She also suggests looking into a variety of classes and to not fixate on getting into one specific class. The Global Studies department approves new courses each quarter, and updates its website to ease the anxiety of enrollment.

Valdivieso cannot enroll students who want, and do not need, a specific course. Because the department makes an effort to not overwork its TAs, Valdivieso has to deny students who ask for PTEs or for her help in enrolling when they solely want a class. Valdivieso states that the hardest part of enrollment for her is saying no to students: “I see their situation and I wish I can help, but I just can't. So, usually we work together [to find] options.”

However, if a student is at risk of not graduating on time, Valdivieso will work something out for the student to fulfill that requirement, whether that be manually enrolling a student in a class or substituting another class to fulfill that requirement. She can work more closely with students to find a solution because the Global Studies department is a smaller program. In almost fifteen years of experience, Valdivieso has not seen a student postpone graduation due to enrollment issues.

While the department is continuously hiring, there is a limited number of faculty. Therefore, the department cannot offer each course multiple times in an academic year. Valdivieso states that the University often times has difficulty in predicting which classes will be popular each quarter, and thus which courses to pour resources into. Some classes are less popular than expected, while others fill up quickly.

Valdivieso shares that academic counselors know that enrollment is not ideal: “I completely understand how difficult it is and we're there with you all. And we see it, and it's painful for us too.”

#### Insights

Popular classes also cause various enrollment frustrations. We found that nine courses filled up within an hour: Applied Linguistics 40W; Ecology and Evolutionary Biology 101, 183, C126, M157; Environmental Science M153; Microbiology, Immunology, & Molecular Genetics 158; Scandanavian Studies 50W; and Society and Genetics M140.

Sandanavian Studies 50W is known for being a class that students do well in, making it a very popular general education course, especially for people who need to do well in a Writing II requirement. We expected Scand 50W to fill up quickly, but we did not expect the course to fill up within an hour.

Something about % of classes that fill up? Talk about some classes with huge spikes such as econ 101 or stats 10?

#### About the Data

Disclaimers

- Some classes were closed by their department until a specified time
- All data is from the initial Winter 2020 enrollment period. No data was collected after second pass ended
- UCLA updates the number of total seats per class once the quarter begins, so the number of seats on the current registrar may be different from the number of seats in the data

#### DATA COLLECTION

A script was run every hour to scrape the public UCLA registrar. In some cases, a classes’ data was not collected by the script. In these cases, we used the last collected value (If we couldn’t get how full Chem 20A was at 4:00 p.m., we would fill that data in with the value from 3:00 p.m.)
