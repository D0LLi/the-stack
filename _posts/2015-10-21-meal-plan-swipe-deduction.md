Hundreds of students woke up Wednesday morning to an email from UCLA Housing & Hospitality Services that said their number of remaining meal plan swipes was lowered, following an internal error that artificially raised students’ swipe counts at the start of the month.

The email to students with Premier meal plans said UCLA Housing officials recently discovered the BruinCard system erroneously reset students’ swipe counts on Oct. 1. After the reset, students with the 14 Premier meal plan had 154 swipes, and those with the 19 Premier plan had 209 swipes.

The email also said the number of swipes students used between the start of the quarter and Oct. 1 was deducted from their swipe counts and that the number of swipes deducted was specific to each student.

Housing officials said they would host an additional themed dinner at a dining hall during fall quarter to thank students for their understanding.

They plan to use a case-by-case appeal process for students who overused their swipes as a result of the error.

We [conducted a survey among students who were affected](https://docs.google.com/a/g.ucla.edu/forms/d/1R1T99kVaP13nFn_0uaNJtfRxjGp5caGrzLrgJAJeTUg/viewform?usp=send_form#start=invite), asking them how many swipes they had deducted from their meal plan and what they thought. As of publishing, **313** students responded, and **135** left additional comments.

<span class="big-number">24</span> students said they thought Housing officials **deducted more swipes than they used** in the specified period.

<span class="big-number">16</span> said they thought  the **university should take responsibility** for the mistake or that it's the university's responsibility to keep accurate track of their swipes.

<span class="big-number">16</span> students said they **adjusted their swiping habits** and swiped friends or swiped more often than usual based on the inflated swipe count.

<span class="big-number">13</span> said they thought Housing's offer of an additional **theme dinner** was inadequate compensation.

<span class="big-number">6</span> expressed frustration with Housing's **lack of transparency**, and suggested an online balance or transaction record to monitor their usage.

The graph omits five outliers in which students reported they had lost a greater amount of swipes than those displayed below.

We're not sure why there appear to be anomalies at round numbers – 10, 20 and 30. It may be a result of respondents rounding, or it may be a result of Housing rounding.

As of publishing, we received **313** responses. The median number of swipes deducted according to respondents was **21** with a standard deviation of **11.0**.
