### About the Data

The dataset analyzed contains the average GPA of students who graduated with a degree from UCLA from Fall 2013 to Summer 2018. Majors with less than 10 degrees awarded during a year will be excluded for student privacy reasons. Therefore, we do not have average GPA per year for the major Computational and Systems Biology, but we do have the average GPA for the major over the span of 2013-2018. 

Furthermore, for the students who graduated with multiple degrees, such as double majors, their GPAs will be counted in both major. For example, if a student double majored in Statistics and Economics, their final GPA will be used as a data point for both Statistics and Economics majors.
