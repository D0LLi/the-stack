key_takeaways:
    - Visualize chances of getting an A in different GE classes and lookup any GE!
    - Science GE's have the toughest curves. Visual and Performance Arts GE's are the most generous.
    - Some "easy" GE's are not always easy because curves can vary a lot between sections.

GE classes can be great grade boosters. Well-researched picks, to be exact.

The latest [Bruinwalk](http://www.bruinwalk.com/) data offers an unprecedented look at letter grade distributions of every class that was taught between Fall 2012 and Fall 2015.

It is also a great guide for choosing easy GE's.

There are many ways we can measure the difficulty of a GE class aside from grades. Difficulty of content, workload, frequency of assessments, etc.

In this post, we'll use the **percentage of students who got A+, A or A-** (or "A's") in a given class as our metric. While it ignores grades below A's and does not present a complete picture of curves, it is the most intuitive metric for students who simply want to choose GE grade boosters.

A's boost grades. B's and C's? Not so much.

<div id="visualization"></div>

## A bird's eye view of all GE's

In the following scatterplot, x axis shows the *median percentage of students who got A's* across different sections of a class. Y axis shows the *number of times that class was taught* between Fall 2012 and Fall 2015.

<blockquote class="note">
    <p>
    * Maybe you don't care how frequently a class is taught, but imagine not having a y axis: circles would fall onto a single line and our chart would be a huge mess.
    </p>
    <p>
    * A "frequently taught" class had been offered at least five times since Fall 2012. An "easy" class had at least 60% of students getting A's. A "hard" class had at most 30% of students getting A's. A "large" class had a median class size of at least 100. And a "small" class had a median class size of at most 40. (Arbitrary? Yes.)

## Why science GE's have the toughest curves

When we examine the average GE grades of each requirement, we find that science GE's have the toughest curves. Typically, only 30% of students who took a Physical Sciences GE got an A.

Life Science GE's are the second least generous with 40% of students getting A's on average.

On the other hand, students were twice as likely to get A's in a typical Visual and Performance Arts class.

Check out the chart below:

<div id="req-barchart">
</div>

Why might this be the case? Aside from the general pattern that North campus classes have better curves than South campus ones (subject for a separate post), there is another possible explanation.

You may recognize from the list below that many of the tougher science GE's are actually core classes many South campus students have to take. In fact, many of them are also known as "weeder" classes.

<table id="science" class="ui celled table" width="100%">
  <caption>Science GE's</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Subject</th>
      <th>CatalogNo</th>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>PercentA</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
</table>

<br />

On the other hand, the concept of core lower division classes does not exist in North campus departments. Take a look at the list of Literary and Cultural GE's below. We notice that they are offered by a great number of departments and it is likely that students who take these classes as GE's will join other students who major or minor in one of these departments.

Therefore, none of these classes is disproportionally likely to be populated by the most competitive pre-professional students who have to take designated core classes.

<table id="lit" class="ui celled table" width="100%">
  <caption>Literary and Cultural GE's</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Subject</th>
      <th>CatalogNo</th>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>PercentA</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
</table>

## Some GE's have very inconsistent curves section-to-section

The median statistics don't quite capture how professors often do not rely on a consistent grading scheme. An analysis of the complete grades dataset actually revealed that sometimes even the same professors who taught the same class graded *very* differently section to section.

GE classes are no different.

Some "typically super easy" GE's are not *always* super easy. For example, median suggests that typically 76% of students who took *German 102: War, Politics, Art* got A's. But in two of the five sections, less than half the students got A's.

  <figcaption>An easier section of German 102 in Summer 2015</figcaption>
</figure>

Therefore it is important to take a [slightly more involved approach](http://www.bruinwalk.com/professors/peter-tokofsky/german-102/#term-selector) when picking classes that have inconsistent curves section-to-section. [Researching professors and reading reviews](http://www.bruinwalk.com/) can mitigate some of that uncertainty.

</figure>

**But which classes have inconsistent curves and require you to do more research?**

Let's look at four GE's that have the most variation in terms of *median percentage of students who got A's*:

<blockquote class="note">
These two graphs provide a sense of what grade variation "looks" like. Whether circles are spread apart or squished together suggests how much curves differ between sections. As each color represents a professor, circles of the same color that are spread apart suggests unpredictable grading scheme by the same professor.
</blockquote>

We can see that the lucky students who took *EPS SCI 15: Intro to Oceanography* had between 61% and 84% chance of getting A's. The unlucky ones were in sections where the instructors gave less than 30% of students A's!

  <img src="/img/posts/grades-ge/most-var.png" height="400px" width="400px" />
  <figcaption>4 GE's that have the biggest grade variation between sections</figcaption>
</figure>

At other end of the spectrum, students who took *LIFESCI 15: Concepts and Issues* across ten different sections over last three years were graded on roughly the same curves. 33% of students got A's at a minimum and 37% at a maximum. A very tiny variation.

  <img src="/img/posts/grades-ge/least-var.png" height="400px" width="400px" />
  <figcaption>4 GE's that have the smallest grade variation between sections</figcaption>
</figure>

We could attribute this to two factors. 1) Professor Jay Phelan made a deliberate choice to grade consistently and; 2) core lower division classes tend to have consistent curves.

In most cases though, data backs up students' obsession with picking the right section or the right quarter to take a class.

#### Curious about the curve consistency of a particular GE class you have in mind?

Play around with the searchable table below:

<blockquote class="note">
  Only classes that had been taught at least 3 times since Fall 2012 show up. Initially sorted from most to least standard deviation. Same metric (% of A's) as above.

## Lookup any GE!

Looking for a specific class? Trying to find the perfect GE? Use the searchable table below:

  Only classes that had been taken by at least 50 students since Fall 2012 show up in this table

In the coming weeks, we will look at the grades dataset from different angles. Which professors are harder than department average? Do smaller classes really have better curves than larger ones? ...

## About the data

The grades data was obtained with a public records request to the UCLA registrar. It contains grade distributions for each class from Fall 2012 to Fall 2015 for classes with more than 10 students.
