### Introduction

Sam Mazariegos, a third year Human Biology and Society major says "UCLA is in the middle of LA. So it makes sense for it to reflect the actual demographics of LA”. 

“I always felt like kind of out of place in the student body because I didn’t see a lot of Latinx students in my classes and in my own major.” says Yesenia Flores, a second-year hispanic student studying Art. 


On Dec 20th 2020, Chancellor Gene Block announced that UCLA has planned to become a Hispanic Serving Institution by 2025. This designation would be given if UCLA’s student population was at least 25% Latinx students and would be accompanied by a range of new grants that UCLA could qualify for. In his announcement, the Chancellor noted that these new grant qualifications could assist in strengthening education programs and benefitting Latinx students at UCLA and that “research has shown that HSI designation strengthens interracial relations among all students, improves academic performance and attendance of students of color, and increases their likelihood of graduation”. 

In this article, The Stack will be looking into how much UCLA will have to increase admissions to become an HSI, how we stack up to other UCs with HSI designations, and if graduation rates for Latinx students improve with HSI standing. It’ll also take a look at the grant allocations for HSIs and how much grant funding UCLA may get from their new status.  

### About The Data


### The Story in Graduation Rates

With this new designation many are hoping that UCLA will not just admit students, but help them thrive. After hearing about UCLA’s goals to become a Hispanic Serving Insitution by 2025, Sam hopes the school might be able to have more cultural competency, accesibility, and more resources to help Latinx students succeed at UCLA. She says, “It’s a good step forward but I just hope that they actually follow through with it and start giving resources to the Latinos on campus to get to graduation and to be successful”. Graduation rates are one marker of how well a school supports students beyond admissions. Looking at other HSIs, we see *insert*

### Changes in Grant Funding

One major aspect of HSI designation is being qualified for a large range of grants which are to be used to help Latinx communities and resources at the instution. In this, we take a look at how grant funding and allocation shifted for different UCs once they were given HSI status.

Sam says she hopes more grant funding will lead to better and more accessible programs from the administration, noting that while resources are there, they're often hard to find and right now, "Latino students have a good amount of resources to go to, but a lot of them are student led. So it doesn’t feel like administration is really playing a big role in them or even funding them as much as they should". 


### Overview

### Analysis

### Conclusion 

In conclusion UCLA has the potential and resources to become an HSI by 2025. The question is not whether they can, but how they will go about achieving this goal. 

Yesenia, who attended a predominantly Latinx high school notes, “The only colleges I eve saw reaching out to my high school were community colleges. I think UCs are always scary, especially if you come from high school where you’re like ‘Oh only 3 people got admitted last year’, it’s like, it’s really discouraging. So I think that in that sense they haven’t done a good job at presenting themselves as an option for those students.” She says “A lot of students are really competent and capable in predominantly Latinx high schools. If they are actually going to connect with high schools that have populations that are predominantly Latinx then it’s possible”.  

Students are optimistic and excited for the increase in diversity, but are uncertain about the University's commitment to providing all the resources to truly assist the Latinx student community. They hope the status of HSI  serves as more than just a title. "I hope that they don’t forget that we’re not just tokens for them and that they actually give us what we deserve" says Sam. “What exactly are they going to implement to follow through with the goals that they have?" Yesenia asks.
