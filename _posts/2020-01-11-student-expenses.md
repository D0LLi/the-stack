## Introduction
UCLA students are required to cover not just tuition, rent, and utilities but also travel costs to and from their hometowns, application and standardized test fees, and for some, visa fees and the cost of the TOEFL. Using data from UCLA and outside sources, we've computed the average annual cost of attendance for in-state, out-of-state, and international students. Additionally, we have also created a [cost calculator](#ucla-cost-of-college-calculator) that you can use to calculate your true cost of attendance based on your preferences

### Totals Comparison

The average total cost of attendance for students varies depending on whether those students are in-state, out-of-state, or international. While the cost of living in Westwood doesn't depend on whether or not a student is a California resident, non-resident students are responsible for cost of supplemental tuition and can incur higher travel costs, higher application costs, and visa fees, all of which will be discussed in later sections.

| Type of Student | Average Cost of College | [Tuition](#tuition) | [Housing](#housing) | [Flights](#transportation) | [Living](#cost-of-living) | [Application](#cost-of-applying) |
|-----------------|-------------------------|---------|---------|---------|--------|-------------|
| In-State        | $32018.27                      |$13,239         | $12498.2        |  $62.83        | $6084.74       | $133.50              |
| Out-of-State    | $62302.94                      | $43,093         |  $12498.2       |$493.50         | $6084.74       | $133.50            |

## Breakdown of Costs

### Tuition
Sources: According to [UCLA](http://www.admission.ucla.edu/Prospect/budget.html), tuition for the 2019-2020 school year is as follows (note that these amounts are what a student would pay per year):

| Type of Student | Cost of Tuition |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| In-State        | $13,239         |
| Out-of-State    | $43,093         |
| International   | $43,093         |

Additionally, the UC Regents Board [voted last spring](https://dailybruin.com/2019/05/16/uc-board-of-regents-votes-to-increase-nonresident-tuition-by-762-per-year/) to increase non-resident tuition by $762 per year and allocate 10% of the revenue generated by this increase to financial aid.

            		}
        		}]
    			}
				}
			})
  </script>          

### Housing
For most students who choose to live near campus, there are three options: living on the hill, living in university owned apartments, or living in non-university owned apartments. We calculated the average annual cost for each option. 
Note that when we computed the cost of living on the hill, we assumed a meal plan of 14P. 

| Type of Student 		| Average Cost of Housing |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| Hill            		| $16,625                  |      
| Off-Campus      		| $10,336.25                 |     
| University Apartments | $9,364.63						  |

            		}
        		}]
    			}
				}
			})
</script>


### Transportation
A [2015 study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17445647.2015.1061463) revealed that flight prices could be estimated by the distance travelled and the length of the flight.
For instance, flights that took less than 3 hours and covered less than 2,000 kilometers one way were 0.256 USD per kilometer to buy a round trip ticket between those cities, while flights that took between 3 and 6 hours and covered between 2,001 and 4,000 kilometers one way were 0.160 USD per kilometer for a round trip ticket. The flights that were used to compute these estimates were all round trip flights from 2010.

Students who live in California may choose to take a bus or a train home instead during school breaks. The average cost of transportation for in-state students reflects this--we computed it by looking at costs of bus and plane tickets.

| Type of Student | Average Cost of Transportation |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| In-State        | $62.83                 	   |
| Out-of-State    | $493.50                	   |
| International   | $1510.61               	   |

	})
</script>

### Cost of Living
Students who live off campus must cover the costs of food, utilities and WiFi, transportation, and health insurance. Below is the average cost of living for students living on the hill, in university apartments, and in non-university apartments. Note that the transportation cost is the average cost for one adult to have a car in Los Angeles, and it includes gas and insurance but not parking. The cost of insurance is the 2019 - 2020 cost of UCShip.

| Type of Student 		| Average Cost of Living  | Food    | Utilities | Transportation | Insurance |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|---------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| Hill            		| $2,516.70		          | N/A	    | N/A	    | N/A			 | $2,516.70 |     
| Off-Campus      		| $10,058.70		                  | $2,412  | $2,124    | $3,006     	 | $2,516.70 |   
| University Apartments | $5678.82						  | $2,412  | N/A	    | $750.12	     | $2,516.70 |

### Cost of Applying
(--this section requires fixing, cost of ACT has changed)
It also costs money to apply to UCLA--not only is there an application fee, but the mandatory standardized tests come with their own fees as well. These tests are also more expensive for international students--they come with additional fees for being administered outside of the United States. International students are also responsible for the cost of a visa and I-Start, an online resource to help them acclimate to living in the United States.

| Type of Student | Average Application Cost | SAT\ACT (Average) FIX THIS ACT IS NOW 68 | Application Fee | TOEFL | Visa | I-Start |
|-----------------|--------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------|------|---------|
| In-State        | $133.50                  | $63.50            | $70             | $0    | $0   | $0      |
| Out-of-State    | $133.50                  | $63.59            | $70             | $0    | $0   | $0      |
| International   | $539.50                  | $139.50           | $70             | $170  | $160 | $59     |

## Conclusion
There are a variety of costs associated with being an undergraduate at UCLA--tuition, housing, health insurance. There are also a number of ways students can bring these costs down: they can, for instance, live in a university apartment as they tend to be cheaper than both the hill and non-university apartments. However, some fees are nonnegotiable: in addition to supplemental tuition for non-residents, there are also higher travel costs for students who live farther away,  and TOEFL, visa, and increased standardized test fees for international students. UCLA is a well regarded research institution--and its high cost is the price students pay to be here.
