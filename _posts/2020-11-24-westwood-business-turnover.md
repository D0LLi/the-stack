## Introduction

The spread of COVID-19 has devastated many businesses across the U.S. According to Yelp’s Local Economic Impact Reports in August 2020, “163,735 total U.S. businesses on Yelp have closed since the beginning of the pandemic (observed as March 1)...with 60% of those closed businesses not reopening (97,966 permanently closed)”  . However, its Annual 2020 report indicates that many businesses have reopened towards the end of 2020 and new restaurants/food businesses were opening near pre-pandemic levels. The Stack investigated trends in business opening and closures in Westwood before and during the pandemic to look into how COVID-19 has impacted businesses specifically in Westwood. 

## About the Data

## Overview

Before studying the impact of COVID-19 on Westwood businesses in detail, it is important to see an overview of the current active businesses in Westwood.  For more detailed information, you can check out the https://thewestwoodvillage.com/directory/ where you can find the most updated list of the names of operating businesses. The visualization below divides current active businesses into 7 main categories which are further broken down. From this graph, we can see clearly that the dining businesses are the most active category, with the daily service businesses coming in the second place.

The timeline below shows the closing and opening dates of businesses that closed specifically in 2020. One might assume that since the old businesses (opened 10 years ago) would be more immune to the negative effects of Covid-19 because of their mature business models and their loyal customer base, but in fact, they are also facing the danger of shutting down. Among the ____ businesses shutting down, the businesses first opened before 2011 take___%. We also calculated the shut-down rate for young and old businesses (will do this later)

## Analysis

To further study how westwood businesses are impacted by the Covid-19, we can take a look at how many businesses are closed and opened in each month of 2020. To make the numbers more meaningful, we compare them with the data we have from 2018 and 2019.

Before doing the analysis, we guessed there would be fewer businesses opened and more businesses closed in 2020 compared to 2019 and 2018. Since people might be afraid of the uncertainty brought by the Covid-19 and face the difficulty of planning their business activities accordingly, they would tend to choose not to open new businesses in Westwood. Our reasoning for the increasing number of closed businesses is due to the negative impact of Covid-19 on Westwood. For example, with the quarters becoming online, a lot of UCLA students left Westwood, which led to fewer consumers. Together with the declining number of consumers was the shrinking business revenue. In this way, it would be even more difficult for the Westwood businesses to maintain their operation. 

However, based on the barplot, we can clearly see that compared to the previous two years, there are considerably fewer businesses closed and opened for each month of 2020. On average, _businesses were closed and ___ businesses were opened monthly in 2020, while the average numbers of opening and closing businesses were __ and __ respectively in 2019;in 2018, ______.  That is to say, we are right about the decreasing number of opened businesses but wrong about the number of closed businesses. 

To make sure the anomaly is not a mere coincidence, we dig deeper to explore the data of Westwood business in the past 20 years. Here, we used the close-to-open-business ratio to reflect the well-being of Westwood businesses. From the graph below, we see that the ratio is the highest around 2008, which makes sense since the Financial Crisis negatively impacted the national economy starting from 2008. However, even though one might think Covid-19 would hit the Westwood businesses as hard as the 2008 Financial Crisis, the ratio of 2020 is actually the lowest of the past 20 years.

We found out the top 5 business categories at Westwood and checked the number of active businesses in 2018, 2019, and 2020. We can observe that at the beginning of 2018 and 2019, there are huge boosts in the graph, which means fair amounts of businesses that fall in the five categories opened their business as the new year started. However, in 2020, due to the pandemic, less companies chose to do so.  
The top 5 business categories are: Independent artists, writers, & performers, All other personal services, All other professional, scientific, & technical services, Management, scientific, & technical consulting services, and Lessors of real estate (including mini warehouses & self-storage units)
Independent artists, writers, & performers include companies that produce films and animation, such as “Noise Nest Animation”. 
All other personal services include tourist and cleaning companies. 
All other professional, scientific include consulting firms. 

However, sources from the Westwood Village Improvement Association suggests that business closures in 2020 were higher compared to previous years. Andrew Thomas, the executive director of Westwood Village Improvement Association, states that the vacancy rate of storefronts in Westwood went from 22% in 2018 to 31% in 2020. The difference in the trends may have resulted from the fact that the data we used includes all businesses in Westwood, including independent businesses and those in UCLA while the data from the association does not.
