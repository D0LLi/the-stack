The start of each school year brings new beginnings for the Daily Bruin as its applications start to flood in. With it comes a wave of talented new interns and exciting opportunities for the staff to grow.
</p>

<p class = "para">
The application process itself spans the course of two weeks. First, prospective interns fill out an application online, due October 5 this year, which typically involves a resume drop and responses to short answer questions. The editors then select a subset of the applicants to interview in person. Once the interns have been chosen, they undergo training that spans the rest of the quarter.

<p class = "para">
The opportunity to be hired as a Daily Bruin intern remains competitive. This year boasted a 43 percent overall acceptance rate, comparable to last year’s 42 percent but still a drop to 2016’s 50 percent. The number of applied and accepted interns remained fairly constant; 209 out of 490 interns were accepted this year versus 206 out of 488 interns who were accepted last year. (Note: Radio separated from the Daily Bruin after 2016 and Social did not accept applications for 2018)
</p>

<p class = "para">
Online (including the Stack), the most-applied-to section at 132 applications, became even more competitive this year. Not only does the section continue to have twice the applicants of other major sections, but also it halved the number of its accepted interns this year to 17. These combined resulted in the section this year having a stark 13 percent acceptance rate.
</p>

<p class = "para">
Not all was woe for this year’s applicants, however. Graphics has a major boost in intern power, increasing its intern size from five to nine. News also experienced growth changes; while the number of applicants nearly doubled from last year, it took 50 percent more interns. Opinion also increased its intern class from 11 in 2017 to 24 this year.

<p class = "para">
This year, first year students comprised the majority of the incoming Daily Bruin intern class, at a total of 51%. They dominated the Photo and Design intern classes, comprising 73% and 90% of each class, respectively. Furthermore, nearly seven times more first years were admitted than fourth years.
</p>

<p class = "para">
The second most represented age groups were second and third year students. The number of second year student interns was comparable to the number of third year students, with second year students trailing third year students by 1%. Second year students comprised 44% of both Graphics’ and Video’s incoming classes. On the other hand, third year students comprised 35% of the Online intern class and 33% of the Blogging class.
</p>

<p class = "para">
Though second and third year students were well represented in certain sections, the proportion of accepted interns per class decreased as age increased.

<div id="majors-graph" align="center"></div>

<p class = "para">
Daily Bruin's incoming class represents a total of 74 undergraduate and graduate majors. The most diverse section is News, with 23 majors represented. The least diverse sections is Online, with only 7 majors represented.
(Note: Double majors are counted as two people with single majors.)
</p>

<p class ="para">
In some sections, a single major comprises the significant plurality of the secion. For example, 40% of the 15 Arts section new-hires are English majors, and interestingly, 33% of the 12 Illustrations section new-hires are Psychology majors. Computer Science and Computer Science & Engineering majors comprise 35% and 29%, respectively, of Online section new-hires.
</p>

<p class="para">
Over all sections of the Daily Bruin, English, Psychology, and Economics majors represent the plurality of the incoming class.
</p>

<p class = "para">
Even though the stats and process may seem daunting, new and returning applicants should not be afraid to apply in the future. The Daily Bruin offers its staff countless opportunities to express their journalistic side, whether it be through reporting breaking news, designing stunning illustrations, or creating blog posts. The experience is well worth the application.
