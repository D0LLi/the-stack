## Introduction
UCLA students are required to cover not just tuition, rent, and utilities but also travel costs to and from their hometowns, application and standardized test fees, and for some, visa fees and the cost of the TOEFL. Using data from UCLA and outside sources, we've computed the average annual cost of attendance for in-state, out-of-state, and international students. All sources have been linked.

### Totals Comparison

The average total cost of attendance for students varies depending on whether those students are in-state, out-of-state, or international. While the cost of living in Westwood doesn't depend on whether or not a student is a California resident, non-resident students are responsible for cost of supplemental tuition and can incur higher travel costs, higher application costs, and visa fees, all of which will be discussed in later sections.

| Type of Student | Average Cost of College | Tuition | Housing | Flights | Living | Application |
|-----------------|-------------------------|---------|---------|---------|--------|-------------|
| In-State        | $32018.27                      |$13,239         | $12498.2        |  $62.83        | $6084.74       | $133.50              |
| Out-of-State    | $ 62302.94                      | $43,093         |  $12498.2       |$493.50         | $6084.74       | $133.50            | 
| International   | $63756.05                       |  $43,093        |   $12498.2      |$1510.61         |  $6084.74      | $569.50            |

## Breakdown of Costs

### Tuition
Sources: According to [UCLA](http://www.admission.ucla.edu/Prospect/budget.html), tuition for the 2019-2020 school year is as follows (note that these amounts are what a student would pay per year):

| Type of Student | Cost of Tuition |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| In-State        | $13,239         |
| Out-of-State    | $43,093         |
| International   | $43,093         |

Additionally, the UC Regents Board [voted last spring](https://dailybruin.com/2019/05/16/uc-board-of-regents-votes-to-increase-nonresident-tuition-by-762-per-year/) to increase non-resident tuition by $762 per year and allocate 10% of the revenue generated by this increase to financial aid.

            }]
            }
            }
        })


### Housing
For most students who choose to live near campus, there are three options: living on the hill, living in university owned apartments, or living in non-university owned apartments. We calculated the average annual cost for each option. 
Note that when we computed the cost of living on the hill, we assumed a meal plan of 14P. 

| Type of Student 		| Average Cost of Housing |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| Hill            		| $16,625                  |      
| Off-Campus      		| $10,336.25                 |     
| University Apartments | $9,364.63						  |


### Transportation
A [2015 study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17445647.2015.1061463) revealed that flight prices could be estimated by the distance travelled and the length of the flight.
For instance, flights that took less than 3 hours and covered less than 2,000 kilometers one way were 0.256 USD per kilometer to buy a round trip ticket between those cities, while flights that took between 3 and 6 hours and covered between 2,001 and 4,000 kilometers one way were 0.160 USD per kilometer for a round trip ticket. The flights that were used to compute these estimates were all round trip flights from 2010.

Students who live in California may choose to take a bus or a train home instead during school breaks. The average cost of transportation for in-state students reflects this--we computed it by looking at costs of bus and plane tickets.

| Type of Student | Average Cost of Transportation |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| In-State        | $62.83                 |
| Out-of-State    | $493.50                |
| International   | $1510.61               |

### Cost of Living
Students who live off campus must cover the costs of food, utilities and WiFi, transportation, and health insurance. Below is the average cost of living for students living on the hill, in university apartments, and in non-university apartments. Note that the transportation cost is the average cost for one adult to have a car in Los Angeles, and it includes gas and insurance but not parking. The cost of insurance is the 2019 - 2020 cost of UCShip.

| Type of Student 		| Average Cost of Living  | Food    | Utilities | Transportation | Insurance |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|---------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| Hill            		| $2,516.70		          | N/A	    | N/A	    | N/A			 | $2,516.70 |     
| Off-Campus      		| $10,058.70		                  | $2,412  | $2,124    | $3,006     	 | $2,516.70 |   
| University Apartments | $5678.82						  | $2,412  | N/A	    | $750.12	     | $2,516.70 |


### Costs of Applying--this section requires fixing, cost of ACT has changed
It also costs money to apply to UCLA--not only is there an application fee, but the mandatory standardized tests come with their own fees as well. These tests are also more expensive for international students--they come with additional fees for being administered outside of the United States. International students are also responsible for the cost of a visa and I-Start, an online resource to help them acclimate to living in the United States.

| Type of Student | Average Application Cost | SAT\ACT (Average) FIX THIS ACT IS NOW 68 | Application Fee | TOEFL | Visa | I-Start |
|-----------------|--------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------|------|---------|
| In-State        | $133.50                  | $63.50            | $70             | $0    | $0   | $0      |
| Out-of-State    | $133.50                  | $63.59            | $70             | $0    | $0   | $0      |
| International   | $539.50                  | $139.50           | $70             | $170  | $160 | $59     |


## Conclusion
There are a variety of costs associated with being an undergraduate at UCLA--tuition, housing, health insurance. There are also a number of ways students can bring these costs down: they can, for instance, live in a university apartment as they tend to be cheaper than both the hill and non-university apartments. However, some fees are nonnegotiable: in addition to supplemental tuition for non-residents, there are also higher travel costs for students who live farther away,  and TOEFL, visa, and increased standardized test fees for international students. UCLA is a well regarded research institution--and its high cost is the price students pay to be here.

## Methodology--can get rid of this later if we want.
### Housing
Here is how we calculated the above averages:
ON CAMPUS HOUSING: LIVING ON THE HILL
We used data from the 2019 - 2020 school year with a meal plan of 14P to compute the average annual cost by number of roommates.
Single = average of 19,259.16 and 21,092.28 = 20,175.72 ([Classic single](https://portal.housing.ucla.edu/my-housing/rate-contracts-rules/2019-2020-classic-residence-hall-single-rates) or a [plaza single](https://portal.housing.ucla.edu/my-housing/rate-contracts-rules/2019-2020-residential-plaza-single-room-suite-shared-bath-rates)).
Double = average of 15,923.52, 16,817.28, 18,479.40, and 18,837.36 = 17,514.39 ([Classic double](https://portal.housing.ucla.edu/my-housing/rate-contracts-rules/2019-2020-classic-residence-hall-double-rates), [deluxe double](https://portal.housing.ucla.edu/my-housing/rate-contracts-rules/2019-2020-deluxe-residence-hall-double-rates), [residential suite](https://portal.housing.ucla.edu/my-housing/rate-contracts-rules/2019-2020-residential-suite-plaza-double-room-shared-bath-rates), [residential plaza](https://portal.housing.ucla.edu/my-housing/rate-contracts-rules/2019-2020-residential-plaza-double-room-private-bath-rates)).
Triple = average of 13,217.16, 14,081.28, 15,891.60, and 16,176.60 = 14841.66 ([Classic triple](https://portal.housing.ucla.edu/my-housing/rate-contracts-rules/2019-2020-classic-residence-hall-triple-rates), [Deluxe triple](https://portal.housing.ucla.edu/my-housing/rate-contracts-rules/2019-2020-deluxe-residence-hall-triple-rates), [residential suite](https://portal.housing.ucla.edu/my-housing/rate-contracts-rules/2019-2020-residential-suite-plaza-triple-room-shared-bath-rates), [residential plaza](https://portal.housing.ucla.edu/my-housing/rate-contracts-rules/2019-2020-residential-plaza-triple-room-private-bath-rates)).

Note that students who choose 11R, 14R, or 19R will have lower average costs while students who choose 19P will have higher average costs.
The average of residents who choose 14P and live on campus is 17510.59, which is 885.59 higher than the one listed by UCLA. This difference could arise due to a number of reasons: UCLA's calculation could have assumed a different meal plan, or calculated a weighted averaged based on the distribution of students living in various dorms.

ON CAMPUS HOUSING: LIVING IN A UNIVERSITY APARTMENT
We calculated the average cost of living in a university apartment using the data detailed [here](https://portal.housing.ucla.edu/my-housing/rates-contracts-rules/2019-2020-contract-housing-rates-and-payment-plans) for the 2019 - 2020 school year.
Average Annual Cost by Number of Roommates
Single = average of 6,872.00 (note: there is only one type of university apartment that allows for 1 occupant, a studio).
Double = 8,436.00    + 10,488.00    + 10,488.00    + 11,400.00 = 10,203.00 (the first two numbers are from living in a studio and the second two are from living in a 1 bedroom).
Triple = 7,752.00 + 7,752.00 + 10,488.00 + 10,944.00 = 9,234.00 (the first is from a studio, the second from a 1 bedroom, and the last two from a 2 bedroom).
Quadruple = 8,892.00 + 9,120.00 = 9006.00 (both numbers are from a 2 bedroom).
5 Roommates = 8,892.00    + 8,664.00 + 9,120.00 = 8,892.00 (both numbers are from a 2 bedroom).
6 Roommates = 7,752.00 + 8,208.00    + 8,208.00 = 8,056.00 (the first 2 are from 2 bedrooms and the last one from a 3 bedroom)
8 Roommates = 4,788.00 (2 bedroom apartment). only 1 type of university apartment that allows for 8 roommates).
9 Roommates = 7,752.00 + 7,980.00 = 7,866.00 (both are from 3 bedrooms)
Note that if parking is an additional $750.12 per year per occupant to have a parking space.

OFF-CAMPUS HOUSING: The data here comes from [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/), which compiles median rent by county (in this case, the county used was 90024).
For Studio (Median cost: 2149)
One person: 2149
Two people: 1074.50
Three people: 716.33

For Single BedRoom (Median Cost: 2995)
Single: 2995
Double: 1497.5 
Triple: 998.33

For Two Bedroom (Median Cost: 4100)
Two people: 2,050.00.
Three people: 1,366.67.
Four people: 1,025. 
Five people: 820.00.
Six people: 683.33.

OTHER COSTS OF LIVING
1. Food: Using data from 2017, the [California Budget and Policy Center](https://calbudgetcenter.org/resources/making-ends-meet-much-cost-support-family-california/) determined the average cost of groceries for one person living in Los Angeles county is $268 per month. For nine months, the total cost is $2,412. 
2. Utilities and WiFi: the [California Public Utilities Commission](https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/uploadedFiles/CPUC_Public_Website/Content/About_Us/Organization/Divisions/Policy_and_Planning/PPDComparativeAnalysisofUtilityServicesRatesinCAFinal.pdf), calculated the average costs of electricity and gas per month for different regions of California (they divide the state into six regions, and the region LA County belongs in also includes towns and cities like Beverly Hills and San Diego) using data from 2014. They have averages for both the winter and summer. The average cost of electricity per month in the winter in the region of California Westwood belongs in is $88; the average cost of gas in the winter in the region is $38. Data for water was more limited, so the statewide winter average is $60 per month. For WiFi, [Spectrum](https://www.spectrum.com/internet.html) services the Westwood area for $50 month. For nine months, the total cost is $2,124.
3. Transportation (excluding parking): the California Budget and Policy Center reports that the average cost of transportation for one person living in Los Angeles County is $334 per month. Note that parking in Westwood requires additional fees. For nine months, the total is $3,006.
4. Health Insurance: Should a student choose to enroll in [UCShip](https://www.studenthealth.ucla.edu/Portals/27/Documents/insurance/UC%20SHIP%20Benefit%20Highlight%20Summary2019-2020.pdf), it's $838.90 per quarter, or $2,516.70 annually (UCShip lasts for 12 months). Should students opt out of UCShip, the average insurance for 18 - 24 year olds is [$257/month](https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/resources/affordable-care-act/much-health-insurance-cost-without-subsidy), or $3,084 annually. Then, students will pay on average $2,800.35 for insurance per year.

**utilities will vary depending on roommates, use housing-like calculation used above to find average (including internet), also on the hill students don't pay**
**transportation: should we add parking?**
**insurance: cost to cover under parent's insurance, also bruincare is a thing?, evaluate average**
