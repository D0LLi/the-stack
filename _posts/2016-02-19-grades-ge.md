key_takeaways:
    - Visualize chances of getting an A in any GE class you have in mind.
    - Science GE's have the toughest curves. Visual and Performance Arts GE's have the most generous curves.
    - Some "easy" GE's are not always easy because their curves vary a lot between different sections.

GE classes can be great grade boosters. Well-researched picks, to be exact.

The latest [Bruinwalk](http://www.bruinwalk.com/) data offers an unprecedented look at the official grade distributions of all classes that had been taught between Fall 2012 and Fall 2015.

There are a many way we can measure the difficulty of a GE class. Difficulty of content, workload, frequency of assesments are all important. Grades form only part of the picture but many students tend to think of tough classes as those with tough grade curves.

In this post, we'll exclusively use the *percentage of students who got A+, A or A- (A's)* in a given class as the metric. While it doesn't capture the grade distribution below A's, it is the most intuitive metric for students who simply want to choose grade boosters. A's boost grades. B's and C's? Not so much. We can safely ignore them for purpose of clarity.

## A Bird eye view of all GE's

In the following scatterplot, the x axis maps the *median percentage of students who got A's* across different sections of a class.

The y axis maps the number of sections that class had been taught between Fall 12 and Fall 15.

    Perhaps you don't care about how frequently a class is taught? Imagine not having the y axis: circles would fall along a single line and our chart would be a huge mess.

## Science GE's have toughest curves.

When we look at GE grades of each requirement, we find that science GE's have the toughest curves. Only 30% of students who take a typical Physical Sciences GE got an A!

Life Science GE's are the second least generous with 40% of students getting A's.

On the other hand, students wre twice as likely to get A's in a typical Visual and Performance Arts class. Check out the chart below:

</div>

Several things to note. First, science GE's also tend to be core requirements for science majors, pre-meds and engineers. In fact, lower division science classes are well known "weeder" classes.

**Take a look at the table showing all science GE's below.** You may notice that many of the tougher classes are indeed the core classes that south campus students have to take.

<table id="physics" class="ui celled table" width="100%">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Subject</th>
      <th>CatalogNo</th>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>PercentA</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
</table>

Second,


## Some GE's have very inconsistent curves section-to-section

Looking at the median statistic of a paraticular class doesn't quite reflect how professors do not always rely on a consistent grading scheme. In fact, an analysis of the entire complete grades dataset reveals that the same professors who teach a particular class often grade very differently section to section.

Some "easy" GE's are not always easy. For example, on average 76% of students who took *German 1: War, Politics, Art* got A's. But in two of five sections, less than 50% of students got A's.

Therefore it is important to take a [slightly more involved approach](http://www.bruinwalk.com/professors/peter-tokofsky/german-102/#term-selector) when picking classes that have inconsistent curves section to section. [Researching the professor and reading reviews](http://www.bruinwalk.com/) perhaps would mitigate some of the unpredictability.

But which classes have inconsistent curbes and require you to do more research?

GE classes are no different. Let's look at the four GE's that have the most variation in terms of *median percentage of students who got A's*:

The two graphs below offer a sense of how grade variation "looks" like. Whether circles are spread apart or squished together suggests how much the curves for each class varies between sections. Each color represents a professor. For example, circles of the same color which are spread apart suggests unpredictable grading scheme by the same professor.

For example, the lucky students who took *Intro to Oceanography*, had between 61% and 84% chance of getting A's. The unlucky ones were in classes where the professors gave less than 30% of students A's. Each color represent a professor who taught that particular section. Notably, the same professor (insert name) who were generous with 84% of students were much less generous when he taught in the other two quarters.

At other end of the spectrum, students who took *LIFESCI 15* across ten different sections over last three years were given pretty the same curves. 33% of students got A's at a minimum and 37% at a maximum. I would attribute this to two possible factors. 1) Professor Phelan made a deliberate choice to grade consistently. And 2) Core lower division science classes tend to have consistent (and tough) curves.

This very idea of curve variation within the same class explains why students obsess over choosing the right section or the right quarter to take a class.
