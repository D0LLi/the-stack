title: Which GE's are the easiest?
teaser: Picking easy GE's has never been easier.

authors:

key_takeaways:
    - Visualize chances of getting an A in any GE class you have in mind.
    - Science GE's have the toughest curves. Visual and Performance Arts GE's have the most generous curves.
    - Some "easy" GE's are not always easy because their curves vary a lot between different sections.

GE classes can be great grade boosters. Well-researched picks, to be exact.

The latest [Bruinwalk](http://www.bruinwalk.com/) data offers an unprecedented look at the official grade distributions of all classes that had been taught between Fall 2012 and Fall 2015.

## Science GE's have tougher curves. *So*?

When we look at GE grades of each requirement, we find that science GE's have the toughest curves. Only 30% of students who take a typical Physical Sciences GE got an A! Likewise, Life Science GE's are the second least generous with 40% of students getting A's.

On the other hand, students wre twice as likely to get A's in a typical Visual and Performance Arts class. Check out the chart below:

Several things to note. First, science GE's also tend to be core requirements for science majors, pre-meds and engineers. In fact, lower division science classes are well known "weeder" classes.

## Some GE's have very inconsistent curves section-to-section

Looking at the median statistic of a paraticular doesn't quite capture the reality that professors do not usually rely on a consistent grading schemes. In fact, an analysis of the complete grades dataset reveals that the same professors who teach the same class often grade very differently quarter to quarter.


GE classes are no different. Let's look at the 5 GE's that have the most variation in terms of *median percentage of students who got A's*:

The two graphs below offer a sense of how grade variation "looks" like. Whether circles are spread apart or squished together suggests how much the curves for each class varies between sections. Each color represents a professor. For example, circles of the same color which are spread apart suggests unpredictable grading scheme by the same professor.

For example, the lucky students who took *Intro to Oceanography*, had between 61% and 84% chance of getting A's. The unlucky ones were in classes where the professors gave less than 30% of students A's. Each color represent a professor who taught that particular section. Notably, the same professor (insert name) who were generous with 84% of students were much less generous when he taught in the other two quarters.

At other end of the spectrum, students who took *LIFESCI 15* across ten different sections over last three years were given pretty the same curves. 33% of students got A's at a minimum and 37% at a maximum. I would attribute this to two possible factors. 1) Professor Phelan made a deliberate choice to grade consistently. And 2) Core lower division science classes tend to have consistent (and tough) curves.

This very idea of curve variation within the same class explains why students obsess over choosing the right section or the right quarter to take a class. Data seems to support this obsession.

**Curious about the curve consistency of a particular GE class you have in mind?**
