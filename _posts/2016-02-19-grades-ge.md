title: Which GE's are the easiest?
teaser: Picking easy GE's has never been easier.

key_takeaways:
    - Visualize chances of getting an A in different GE classes and lookup any GE you have in mind!
    - Science GE's have the toughest curves. Visual and Performance Arts GE's have the most generous curves.
    - Some "easy" GE's are not always easy because their curves vary a lot between different sections.

GE classes can be great grade boosters. Well-researched picks, to be exact.

The latest [Bruinwalk](http://www.bruinwalk.com/) data offers an unprecedented look at the official letter grades distributions of all classes that had been taught between Fall 2012 and Fall 2015.

There are a many way we can measure the difficulty of a GE class. Difficulty of content, workload, frequency of assesments are all important. So are grades.

In this post, we'll only use the *percentage of students who got A+, A or A- (aka A's)* in a given class as our metric. While it ignores grades below A's, it is the most intuitive metric for students who want to choose GE grade boosters. A's boost grades. B's and C's? Not so much.

## A Bird eye view of all GE's

In the following scatterplot, x axis shows the *median percentage of students who got A's* across different sections of a class. The y axis shows the *number of times that class had been taught* between Fall 12 and Fall 15.

<blockquote class="note">
    Maybe you don't care about how frequently a class is taught, but imagine not having a y axis: circles would fall along a single line and our chart would be a huge mess.

## Why science GE's have the toughest curves

When we look at GE grades of each requirement, we find that science GE's have the toughest curves. Only 30% of students who take a typical Physical Sciences GE got an A!

Life Science GE's are the second least generous with 40% of students getting A's.

On the other hand, students wre twice as likely to get A's in a typical Visual and Performance Arts class. Check out the chart below:


<div id="req-barchart">
</div>

A couple of things to note. First, you may recognize from the table below that many of tougher science GE's are core classes that many south campus students have to take. In fact, many of these lower division classes are also known as "weeder" classes.

<table id="science" class="ui celled table" width="100%">
  <caption>Science GE's</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Subject</th>
      <th>CatalogNo</th>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>PercentA</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
</table>

## Some GE's have very inconsistent curves section-to-section

The median statistic of any particular class doesn't quite capture how professors do not always rely on a consistent grading scheme. An analysis of the complete grades dataset actually revealed that sometimes even the same professors who taught the same class graded *very* differently section to section.

GE classes are no different.

Some "easy" GE's are not always easy. For example, on average 76% of students who took *German 102: War, Politics, Art* got A's. But in two of five sections, less than half of the students got A's.

  <figcaption>A tougher section of German 102 in Spring 2010</figcaption>
</figure>

Therefore it is important to take a [slightly more involved approach](http://www.bruinwalk.com/professors/peter-tokofsky/german-102/#term-selector) when picking classes that have inconsistent curves section to section. [Researching professors and checking out reviews](http://www.bruinwalk.com/) can perhaps mitigate some of that unpredictability.

But which classes have inconsistent curves and require you to do more research?

Let's look at the four GE's that have the most variation in terms of *median percentage of students who got A's*:

<blockquote class="note">
The two graphs below offer a sense of how grade variation "looks" like. Whether circles are spread apart or squished together suggests how much the curves for each class varies between sections. Each color represents a professor. For example, circles of the same color which are spread apart suggests unpredictable grading scheme by the same professor.

  <figcaption>4 GE's that have the largest grade variation between sections</figcaption>

For example, the lucky students who took *Intro to Oceanography* had between 61% and 84% chance of getting A's. The unlucky ones were in classes where the instructors gave less than 30% of students A's.

At other end of the spectrum, students who took *LIFESCI 15: Concepts and Issues* across ten different sections over last three years were graded on pretty much the same curves. 33% of students got A's at a minimum and 37% at a maximum. A very small variation.

</figure>

I would attribute this to two factors. 1) Professor Phelan made a deliberate choice to grade consistently and; 2) core lower division classes tend to have consistent curves.

In most cases though, data seems back up students' obsession with choosing the right section or the right quarter to take a class.

#### Curious about the curve consistency of a particular GE class you have in mind?

Play around with the searchable table below:

<blockquote class="note">Only classes that had been taught at least 3 times since Fall 12 show up. Initially sorted from most to least standard deviation. Same metric (% of A's).

## Lookup any GE!

Looking for a specific GE or take a general look at all GE's? Play with the searchable table below:

<blockquote class="note">
  Only classes that had been taken by at least 50 students since Fall 12 show up in this table
